# DATA334_final_project

# My goal for this final project is to create a shiny app that allows the user to visualize the data in as many different ways as possible!

To start, I'm going to want to include an option to do frequency plots and/or histograms for the salaries per `Job.Title`, per `Employment.Type`, per `Experience.Level`, per `Company.Location`, and per `Company.Size`. I will also include a reactive summary statistics table (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, count).

I also want to allow the user to select any number of years (2020-2024) to be included.
